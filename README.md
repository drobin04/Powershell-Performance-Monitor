# Powershell Performance Monitor
 Powershell script that collects performance stats and saves into a sqlite database.

Useful for quickly tracking CPU, memory usage / free, GPU usage, GPU memory usage, network quality while running a video game or other app.

# Requirements

You may need to update or download the appropriate System.Data.SQLite.dll file in this directory for this script to work. One should be included, but if it doesn't work on your system, you can download them from this URL: https://system.data.sqlite.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/downloads.wiki

NOTE - If script fails to run because 'running scripts is disabled on this system', right click your start menu button and launch powershell as an admin. Then run ' Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted ' and try again.
